# MaCSS_Applied_Statistics_I_Final_Project

This project investigates how the rise of electric vehicle (EV) adoption impacts urban air quality within the nine-county Bay Area, focusing on whether this effect varies between high-density urban regions and suburban regions. The hypothesis posits that EV adoption has a significantly greater positive impact on reducing air pollution levels in high-density urban areas compared to suburban ones. To test this, we want to have more data that show the air quality measures such as PM2.5 and NOx levels, along with EV registration data.
